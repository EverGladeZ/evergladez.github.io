      <h4 class="text-center">Welcome to my portfolio.</h4>
      <p class="text-center">
        Thanks for checking out this website. Ever since I was a child I have
        been fascinated by computers and the seemingly mystic aura surrounding
        them. Throughout my childhood, I would enjoy browsing the early days of
        YouTube, investigating my mother's Blackberry Bold and playing Pokemon
        Emerald on my Gameboy Advance. I look back throughout my life and at
        each stage in my journey there is something that has always remained a
        constant although it was perpetually changing;
        <b>computers</b>.<br /><br />
        Since that time, I have developed a good amount of knowledge in the
        field of computing. I enjoy tough technical challenges and always put
        forth my best efforts towards anything I do when it comes to the field
        that I love. My name is Jakub Wozniak and I am currently 21 years old. I
        was born in Stalowa Wola, Poland and I immigrated to Canada with my
        family when I was 4 years old. Currently, I am studying at the
        University of Guelph, where I am pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Computer
        Science as well as completing a Business minor on the side. I hope this
        website can serve as a tool that grants a view into my life with
        computers.

                      In this section, I will be presenting a full overview of
                      my third co-op workterm with the GroupBy Inc. in Toronto,
                      Ontario as a Frontend Developer. Presented below is
                      information about my S22 co-op employer, a summary of my
                      learning goals, a comprehensive review of the work I
                      completed over the work term and general conclusions drawn
                      from my work term experience.

                    <p>
                      During my third work term as a co-op student, I had the
                      opportunity to work as a Frontend Developer for a company
                      called GroupBy based out of Toronto. The work done at
                      GroupBy is very interesting; the company focuses on
                      providing retail search solutions for B2B and B2C clients.
                      They also provide a variety of tools and insights for the
                      retail space such as AI for search and recommendations,
                      data enrichment, reporting, merchandising as well as
                      analytics. They are partnered with Google and utilize
                      Google’s Retail AI to get the most relevant search results
                      and recommendations on the market. The presales team at
                      GroupBy welcomed me with open arms, provided me with the
                      tools I needed to succeed and allowed me not only to learn
                      but to prosper during my co-op term there. Personally, I
                      found it to be my most enjoyable co-op experience due to
                      the interesting nature of the work coupled with the
                      community feel regardless of whether I was working
                      remotely or at the office.

                    <hr />
                    <div class="container">
                      <p>
                        <b><u>Technological Literacy</u></b>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Goal:</b> The first goal I am striving for this co-op
                        term is to enhance my technological literacy. I feel
                        like I have a lot more to learn about front-end
                        development in a professional setting. I would like to
                        gain more knowledge about front-end development and
                        learn new techniques and practices in the industry.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Action Plan:</b> In order to achieve my goal, I will
                        spend time learning various strategies employed at
                        GroupBy when it comes to creating websites and web
                        applications. I would like to get more familiar with
                        React JS and learn more about the CMS that they use
                        called Crownpeak. These skills will be useful for the
                        rest of my career as they can be easily transferred into
                        other front-end positions.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Measure of Success:</b> In order to see if I achieved
                        my goal, I can reflect and see how much more effectively
                        I can go through the process of developing a webpage and
                        reflect on the work term. How closely and accuruately
                        can I recreate design documents? How well can I match
                        the content that is requested of me?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Reflection:</b> I believe that this co-op work term
                        taught me a lot of new things and definitely enhanced my
                        technology literacy. I gained experience with a variety
                        of new front end tools such as React JS and CMS
                        Crownpeak. I think I learned to recreated design
                        documents much more effectively and match the desired
                        output very well.

                      <p>
                        <b>Goal:</b> The second goal I would like to focus on
                        over this work term is Teamwork. I feel like teamwork is
                        a crucial skill to have not only in the workplace but
                        also in day-to-day life. I would like to collaborate
                        with other co-workers on meaningful projects and
                        overcome any challenges that may present themselves by
                        applying a team effort.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Action Plan:</b> During this placement, I work
                        closely with several co-workers, specifically one that
                        was hired at the same time as me. I look forward to
                        actively collaborating with him on various projects and
                        understanding what is necessary to have a good
                        collaborative environment in a workplace setting.
                        Together we must communicate and overcome obstacles as a
                        team in order to be successful in our positions.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Measure of Success:</b> The way I would measure my
                        success for this goal is to look back on the work term
                        and seeing if my ability to work together with others
                        has improved. Do I value all input from team members? Do
                        I take constructive criticism in a positive manner? Do I
                        split up work fairly and effectively amongst team
                        members?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Reflection:</b> I think throughout this work term I
                        learned how to cooperate with teammates way better than
                        through my previous co-op. During this term I had a
                        variety of moments where teamwork was crucial to my
                        success. I learned to value all input from team members
                        and to take constructive criticism in a good manner. I
                        also think this co-op placement helped me better
                        understand how to split up work fairly amongst the team.

                      <p>
                        <b>Goal:</b> My last goal I would like to achieve
                        through my co-op placement is to improve my oral
                        communication. Being able to effectively convey your
                        thoughts and useful information about tasks at hand is a
                        very valuable skill that can be applied to virtually any
                        social setting or job in this industry.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Action Plan:</b> In order to achieve this goal, I am
                        looking forward to communicating with my co-workers on
                        any issues or blockers I may have. Additionally, I will
                        improve my skills by partaking in a daily standup
                        meeting where I explain what I accomplished the previous
                        day and what I plan to accomplish on the given day.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Measure of Success:</b> The way I would measure my
                        success for this final goal is to look back and see;
                        Have I gotten more comfortable speaking with others? Do
                        I effectively convey my thoughts and any issues I am
                        facing? Am I able to explain things in a way that allows
                        for others to understand me clearly and efficiently?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Reflection:</b> During my work term at GroupBy I
                        definitely improved my oral Communication skills. This
                        was done through meetings, presentations and daily stand
                        ups. I got more comfortable at speaking with others due
                        to the amount of times I was put in those positions. I
                        can clearly convey my thoughts and any issue I have to
                        co-workers or mentors. I also greatly improved my
                        ability to explain tasks with clarity and efficiency to
                        other team members.

                        <b><u>Work Term Summary</u></b>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In the beginning of my work term, I mainly focused on
                        learning and gaining experience with a CMS that GroupBy
                        uses called Crownpeak. This CMS allowed me to discover a
                        variety of interesting new things such as creating
                        reusable HTML components that are made from scratch and
                        can be easily dropped into other page templates.
                        Learning this whole new system was a little challenging
                        at first as there were some things that were more
                        reliant on graphical interfaces rather than traditional
                        coding, however I feel like I adapted quickly. I believe
                        it was beneficial for me to look at other tools used in
                        the industry and see how quickly I can grasp them.
                        <br /><br />
                        With my newly obtained CMS experience I was able to
                        start working on various marketing tasks for the
                        official GroupBy website redesign which was done on
                        Crownpeak. Working on this website redesign consisted of
                        looking at design documents and trying to format the
                        requested pages as closely as possible to the look and
                        functionality requested. This task really allowed me to
                        take a deeper dive into HTML, CSS, JS and even allowed
                        me to work with some animations/transitions, something I
                        haven’t done too much of before. The experience I gained
                        from this task was very valuable as I got a feel for
                        building off of design documents as well as gaining more
                        experience with the Crownpeak CMS.
                        <br /><br />
                        Another key part of my work term with GroupBy was
                        constructing a tool for internal testing of the GroupBy
                        tracking beacons. This tool, nicknamed The Tül, was a
                        web hosted React JS application that took in a variety
                        of necessary variables to set up an API call which
                        returned and cleanly displayed the JSON search results.
                        Once the results were obtained from the API, the app
                        automatically sent a tracking beacon associated with the
                        given search. This tool proved to be very valuable for
                        the company and will continue being used in the future.
                        Additionally to creating this application, one other
                        intern and I had to prepare a show and tell about it at
                        our daily standup meeting. This allowed me to practice
                        my communication and presentation skills in front of
                        other coworkers.
                        <br /><br />
                        On the topic of communication, my time at GroupBy really
                        helped me to become better at conveying my thoughts and
                        participating in a team environment. The daily 30-minute
                        morning standup meetings were something I enjoyed a lot
                        as they allowed me to summarize what I worked on the
                        previous day, what I will be working on currently, and
                        also hear about what my coworkers were up to.
                        Additionally, we occasionally had a retrospective
                        meeting at the end of the week which allowed for
                        reflection on the past week specifically on what the
                        team did right and what the team collectively could’ve
                        done better. These meetings were very insightful, and I
                        always felt like my input was valued just as much as
                        anyone else’s.
                        <br /><br />
                        Finally, the largest challenge I underwent during my
                        Summer 2022 work term was the full-scale React JS web
                        demo the presales team had to produce in a very short
                        time frame for a B2B medical supply prospect. This task
                        involved mimicking the potential client’s website as
                        well as implementing key aspects of GroupBy’s product
                        such as data enrichment and search recommendations in
                        order to show off in a meeting with the prospect. This
                        project required a lot of hard work and perseverance
                        from everyone and a lot of inter-team communication.
                        Since these demo requests come up on short notice, I
                        also happened to be out of the country the week this
                        demo was supposed to be done. As a result, I had to be
                        really disciplined and organized with my time. This
                        experience taught me a lot about how to adapt to your
                        circumstances to meet hard deadlines and how to work in
                        synergy with other team members in order to accomplish
                        all the goals that were set out to be met.

                    <p>
                      Throughout my third co-op placement I have learned a lot
                      and experienced a lot. I got to experience what it was
                      like working for a very interesting company, how they
                      handle their presales operatons and front-end development,
                      as well as develop close bonds with my co-workers over
                      meetings, group chats, office activities and shared
                      lunches. Being surrounded by a welcoming, cheerful and
                      entertaining environment leads to motivation and desire to
                      do your best when it comes time to crunch down and work.
                      The technical knowledge and transferable skills I gained
                      throughout this workterm are priceless and will definitely
                      help me further along my career.

                      I would like to thank GroupBy Inc., specifically the
                      Presales team, for welcoming me with open arms and making
                      me feel valued and right at home. I always felt like an
                      integral part of the team who's ideas, suggestions and
                      opinions were valued and never felt like an intern swamped
                      with boring monotonous work. I would also like to thank
                      Yanish for always being there for me if I had any issues
                      or concerns. During my time there his mentorship was very
                      valuable to me. His knowledge of the field coupled with
                      the effort he puts into his work evidently make Yanish an
                      integral part of the GroupBy team as well as an excellent
                      mentor/leader. Additionally I would like to thank Dan, who
                      was a mentor figure I worked most closely with, for always
                      being patient with me when asking questions and never
                      hesitating to lend a helping hand. I am very grateful for
                      all you have taught me. Once again I would like to express
                      my gratitude to the whole company. I will carry the
                      mentorship and experience I gained from this position with
                      me throughout my career and I am truly grateful to have
                      been able to work for such a fun, interesting and
                      inclusive company. I hope our paths can cross again

                      During my Fall 2021 semester I had the opportunity to work
                      for my own institution, the University of Guelph, as a web
                      developer for their team. The University of Guelph is one
                      of Canada's leading innovation and comprehensive
                      postsecondary institutions. Currently, the university is
                      in the process of modernizing its web presence with an
                      overhaul of its websites introducing brand new web
                      components and styles to give it a cleaner look and a more
                      welcoming feel. I have been fortunate to work with some
                      people on this project while learning completely new
                      things and was welcomed with open arms into this work

                        <b>Goal:</b> The first goal I would like to achieve
                        through my co-op is to improve my technological
                        literacy. I believe that in order to be successful in
                        the computer programming industry you must develop a
                        breadth of knowledge with various technologies. Having a
                        lot of different languages and skills in your toolbox is
                        very valuable and I feel that this placement will
                        accomplish that for me.

                        will be taking a dive into aspects of computer science
                        that I normally haven’t spent much time on. With this
                        placement, I will be learning new skills and tricks to
                        website development. Primarily, I will be greatly
                        improving my HTML, CSS and JS capabilities and learning
                        how the website development process works in a
                        real-world scenario. This sort of hands-on experience in
                        a professional environment will be valuable for the
                        future growth of myself and my career.

                        success for this goal would be to see how much my skills
                        have improved over the course of my work term. Do I
                        understand web development better than I did coming into
                        this job? Could I apply the things I learned in future

                        University of Guelph greatly improved the caliber of my
                        technological literacy. I learned a lot of new things
                        about web development with HTML and specifically CSS. I
                        also learned how to use programs such as MAMP and how to
                        develop high quality websites with tools like Bootstrap
                        JS.

                        <b>Goal:</b> The second goal I would like to focus on
                        over this work term is creativity. I feel like this is
                        one of the most overlooked aspects of computer science.
                        In my opinion, in order to be innovative, successful and
                        create something groundbreaking you need to have the
                        ability to think creatively. To me, this placement is an
                        ideal opportunity to work on this skill.

                        literally be presented with a blank canvas. I will have
                        countless opportunities to test my creativity with
                        various designs and ideas. With web development, you
                        have the freedom to experiment with certain pieces of
                        styling, as well as the opportunity to try different
                        layouts. I believe that this nature of testing designs
                        will apply not only to web development but could also
                        benefit me in other aspects of computer science.

                        success for this goal is to look back on the work term
                        and seeing if the level of my creative thinking has
                        improved. After this work term, do I come up with more
                        ideas? Do I see myself testing various pieces of code
                        more often and trying things I wouldn’t normally try?

                        <b>Reflection:</b> I think this work term greatly helped
                        me improve my creative mind. I was provided with a lot
                        of freedom with web development during this placement
                        and better visualizes ideas I would like to achieve. I
                        also better understand what looks visually appealing and
                        modern when it comes to web design.

                        through my co-op placement is to improve my teamwork.
                        This skill is very important in a computer science job,
                        but also crucial in daily life. Skills that have the
                        ability to be transferred to every aspect of your life
                        and help you grow as a person are valuable and

                      <p>
                        Over the past four months working for the University of
                        Guelph, I have gained tons of valuable experience with
                        web development that I will definitely apply in personal
                        projects and in my future career. Throughout the
                        semester, I was presented with a variety of work item
                        tickets to accomplish on Azure DevOps. This helped me
                        stay focused and provided me with tasks that I had to
                        figure out and accomplish.
                        <br /><br />
                        To start off the work term, I began by familiarizing
                        myself with the main git repository for the University
                        of Guelph website. This involved getting to grips with
                        PHP and understanding how their main code base was
                        structured. I had to brush up on my HTML and learn how
                        to properly structure HTML code utilizing divs and other
                        elements. I learned about JavaScript web components,
                        including how to create, compile and utilize them on a
                        website. Furthermore, I learned how to locally host a
                        server environment using MAMP and polished my version
                        control knowledge by using git to commit and pull
                        changes with Azure DevOps.
                        <br /><br />
                        My next task was to create a prototype framework of a
                        brand-new modernized programs page for the university.
                        This was my first major task I was assigned when I
                        joined the group. To accomplish this task, I was given
                        some concept drawings of what sort of vision the team
                        had for this new page. I studied and learned a lot of
                        CSS and Bootstrap to be able to accomplish what they
                        were looking for. This challenge tested my HTML, PHP,
                        CSS, JavaScript and problem-solving abilities. I had to
                        look up how to accomplish certain things with CSS since
                        I never really looked into it and the caliber of my CSS
                        greatly improved due to this project. In the end I was
                        able to successfully create a functioning programs page
                        framework that I presented to the team in a meeting on
                        Microsoft Teams.
                        <br /><br />
                        Another task I frequently worked on throughout the
                        semester was updating the campus map (<a
                          href="https://uoguelph.ca/maps"
                          >www.uoguelph.ca/maps</a
                        >). This required me to add new buildings using latitude
                        and longitude points to plot out polygons and implement
                        them using the Google Maps API. I needed to add these
                        points into a JSON file that was then passed into some
                        JavaScript that initialized the map. Each marker on the
                        map is also linked to a locations page which needed to
                        be filled in with information about the building and
                        implemented with the proper photos. This part of the job
                        was very rewarding as I constantly got to see visual
                        progress of new buildings popping up on the map and
                        being implemented into the live uoguelph.ca website.

                      Over the Summer 2021 semester I had the pleasure of
                      working for a company by the name of Xiris Automation Inc.
                      in Burlington, Ontario. Xiris specializes in developing
                      machine vision hardware for process and quality control.
                      They have been in the business for over 30 years and have
                      developed high quality cameras focused on weld monitoring
                      and inspection. Xiris’ products provide manufacturers with
                      the ability to accurately detect, recognize and interpret
                      quality defects in their goods. Their cameras also come
                      with a software development kit, Xiris Weld SDK, which
                      allows users to maximize the potential of the cameras and
                      obtain useful machine vision information during the
                      welding process. Xiris has fostered a very welcoming and

                      <p>
                        <b>Goal:</b> My first goal I would like to achieve
                        through my Summer 2021 co-op is to improve my
                        problem-solving skills. I believe problem solving is one
                        of the most important assets for a programmer as
                        constantly and unexpectedly issues can arise in code. I
                        believe having the skill to quickly identify those
                        problems and deal with them in an efficient manner is
                        extremely beneficial.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Action Plan:</b> In order to achieve this goal, I
                        will be placed in a real-world tech environment where I
                        will have a lot of opportunities to problem solve. Any
                        software I write will mostly likely have bugs and other
                        issues I will have to learn to overcome. These may be
                        challenging but will help me grow in my field. In a real
                        world setting I will be more motivated than ever to
                        improve myself as a coder and learn the best methods of
                        trouble shooting which I can transfer into my future
                        career path.

                        <b>Measure of Success:</b> The way I would measure my
                        success is looking back and seeing if the quality and
                        efficiency of my solutions to problems has increased. Do
                        I try to think more analytically, do I analyze a bunch
                        of options and pick the best one?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Reflection:</b> My efficiency of problem-solving has
                        improved over these past four months. Given a lot of
                        autonomy and having to make a lot of decisions, I needed
                        to learn to think analytically and how to make the best
                        decisions. This skill will be extremely useful for any
                        other tech jobs I will have going forward in my career.

                        <b>Goal:</b> My second goal I would like to achieve
                        through my co-op is to improve my technological
                        literacy. Having a lot of different programming
                        languages and experiences in your toolbox is very
                        advantageous in the technology industry. Being able to
                        adapt to your environment using your prior knowledge
                        from past projects and studies is a valuable skill,
                        which I believe I can grow through this placement.

                        <b>Action Plan:</b> In order to achieve this goal, I
                        will learn various new technologies and ways to program.
                        The experience I gain from a real job in my field will
                        be invaluable for me. Primarily I will be polishing my
                        C# skills while also learning new tricks and skills that
                        will accelerate my programming to the next level.
                        Furthermore, I will be learning new technologies to
                        expand my technological literacy such as C++ and SVN and
                        gaining experience working in a real-life setting.

                        success for this goal would be to see how much I have
                        grown in my technological literacy. Have I learned new
                        skills and technologies that will assist me further in
                        my career? Did I effectively absorb all the new
                        information I learned throughout my placement?

                      <p>
                        <b>Reflection:</b> My work term at Xiris definitely
                        helped me achieve my technological literacy goals. I
                        learned and polished my knowledge of two new languages:
                        C# and C++, as well as a new software version control
                        system, Apache Subversion. This knowledge will
                        definitely aid me in future jobs and tech opportunities.

                        <b>Goal:</b> My last goal I would like to achieve
                        through my co-op placement is to be better organized and
                        better manage my time. Sometimes I have time management
                        issues and this placement is extremely valuable in
                        helping me solve these issues and grow as a person. I
                        believe being organized heavily increases productivity
                        and is a very useful skill to adapt not only in a
                        workplace setting but in day to day life.

                      <p>
                        <b>Action Plan:</b> I will be provided a lot of autonomy
                        in my setting and will need to learn how to manage my
                        time wisely. I prefer working on site because it
                        motivates me to install routine values into my day to
                        day life and pushes me to always be punctual. Planning
                        out deadlines for myself will be crucial in helping me
                        become more organized and more efficient in my work.

                        <b>Measure of Success:</b> The way I would measure my
                        success for this final goal is have I improved my
                        organization and time management? Not exclusively in a
                        workplace setting but have the values I learned
                        throughout my placement helped me become not only a more
                        organized, well rounded worker but also a more
                        organized, well rounded person.

                      <p>
                        In my three months working at Xiris Automation Inc, I
                        feel like I have accomplished a lot and learned a
                        tremendous amount. For my first major project, I was
                        tasked with creating a document management system in C#
                        for Xiris’ internal documents. This Windows application
                        was to be designed with the ability to create, read,
                        update and delete documents that were subsequently
                        stored online in a Sharepoint server. Each document was
                        also to be reported in a database that provided further
                        information on it. Xiris had a previous outdated
                        document system which stored the files locally that I
                        could use as a reference to see what they were looking
                        for in terms of functionality. This project came with
                        its fair share of challenges. Having previously only
                        used C# in high school, I needed to quickly adapt to my
                        environment and reach a level of literacy with C# that
                        would allow me to complete my task. I think I managed to
                        do this quite well and I feel very confident in my C#
                        abilities following this work term.
                        <br /><br />
                        Another challenging portion was learning how to connect
                        everything to Sharepoint and figuring out how to use the
                        C# Sharepoint CSOM (Client-Side Object Model). Learning
                        the Sharepoint CSOM resulted in a good amount of
                        researching online and reading through the
                        documentation. When I completed the project, the day
                        came where we finally had to publish and implement the
                        new Sharepoint based document management system. This
                        required uploading all local documents to the Sharepoint
                        Online server and releasing the new software onto the
                        company servers. Most of this process went smoothly,
                        however a small oversight occurred. The Sharepoint login
                        system I created failed to take 2FA into account which
                        effectively nullified the whole project I created.
                        Rather than getting discouraged, I looked into solutions
                        for this and swiftly found a way better method of
                        implementing the Sharepoint login which drastically
                        improved the end result. The new document management
                        system was successfully released on the anticipated
                        date.
                        <br /><br />
                        For my second major project while working at Xiris
                        Automation, I was asked to familiarize myself with their
                        Weld SDK and simulate the process of installing and
                        using the SDK from the perspective of a first-time user
                        noting any flaws with the process. I read through all of
                        the documentation for the software development kit and
                        noted any spelling mistakes or sections that might be
                        perceived as unclear. Once I was finished with the
                        quality assurance, I was then asked to create a couple
                        of samples for the machine vision aspect of the SDK.
                        This was one of the most interesting parts of my work
                        term at Xiris. I was provided with one of their cameras
                        and wrote C++ code samples that demonstrate the
                        different machine vision functionalities available in
                        the SDK. These samples would be included in the SDK when
                        installed. Before this project, I have never used C++,
                        which was more difficult to grasp than C# given its
                        syntax. Eventually after looking through some C++
                        samples online and the Weld SDK documentation, I
                        successfully managed to write some functioning machine
                        vision code that reported on the camera’s video stream
                        in real time.

                      each challenge only forced me to become a better worker
                      and a better person. I am grateful that I had this
