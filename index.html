      <h4 class="text-center">Welcome to my portfolio.</h4>
      <p class="text-center">
        Thanks for checking out this website. Ever since I was a child I have
        been fascinated by computers and the seemingly mystic aura surrounding
        them. Throughout my childhood, I would enjoy browsing the early days of
        YouTube, investigating my mother's Blackberry Bold and playing Pokemon
        Emerald on my Gameboy Advance. I look back throughout my life and at
        each stage in my journey there is something that has always remained a
        constant although it was perpetually changing;
        <b>computers</b>.<br /><br />
        Since that time, I have developed a good amount of knowledge in the
        field of computing. I enjoy tough technical challenges and always put
        forth my best efforts towards anything I do when it comes to the field
        that I love. My name is Jakub Wozniak and I am currently 20 years old. I
        was born in Stalowa Wola, Poland and I immigrated to Canada with my
        family when I was 4 years old. Currently, I am studying at the
        University of Guelph, where I am pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Computer
        Science as well as completing a Business minor on the side. I hope this
        website can serve as a tool that grants a view into my life with
        computers.

                Everglade Messaging is an online messaging web app which was
                created and designed as a side project. Both the backend and the
                frontend of the application were created by two developers. The
                project utilized technologies such as React.js, Heroku, Flask,

                    <p>
                      Over the Summer 2021 semester I had the pleasure of
                      working for a company by the name of Xiris Automation Inc.
                      in Burlington, Ontario. Xiris specializes in developing
                      machine vision hardware for process and quality control.
                      They have been in the business for over 30 years and have
                      developed high quality cameras focused on weld monitoring
                      and inspection. Xiris’ products provide manufacturers with
                      the ability to accurately detect, recognize and interpret
                      quality defects in their goods. Their cameras also come
                      with a software development kit, Xiris Weld SDK, which
                      allows users to maximize the potential of the cameras and
                      obtain useful machine vision information during the
                      welding process. Xiris has fostered a very welcoming and
                      supportive work environment that ultimately leads to great
                      internal productivity and collaboration.

                    <div class="container">
                      <p>
                        <b><u>Problem Solving</u></b>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Goal:</b> My first goal I would like to achieve
                        through my Summer 2021 co-op is to improve my
                        problem-solving skills. I believe problem solving is one
                        of the most important assets for a programmer as
                        constantly and unexpectedly issues can arise in code. I
                        believe having the skill to quickly identify those
                        problems and deal with them in an efficient manner is
                        extremely beneficial.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Action Plan:</b> In order to achieve this goal, I
                        will be placed in a real-world tech environment where I
                        will have a lot of opportunities to problem solve. Any
                        software I write will mostly likely have bugs and other
                        issues I will have to learn to overcome. These may be
                        challenging but will help me grow in my field. In a real
                        world setting I will be more motivated than ever to
                        improve myself as a coder and learn the best methods of
                        trouble shooting which I can transfer into my future
                        career path.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Measure of Success:</b> The way I would measure my
                        success is looking back and seeing if the quality and
                        efficiency of my solutions to problems has increased. Do
                        I try to think more analytically, do I analyze a bunch
                        of options and pick the best one?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Reflection:</b> My efficiency of problem-solving has
                        improved over these past four months. Given a lot of
                        autonomy and having to make a lot of decisions, I needed
                        to learn to think analytically and how to make the best
                        decisions. This skill will be extremely useful for any
                        other tech jobs I will have going forward in my career.

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Goal:</b> My second goal I would like to achieve
                        through my co-op is to improve my technological
                        literacy. Having a lot of different programming
                        languages and experiences in your toolbox is very
                        advantageous in the technology industry. Being able to
                        adapt to your environment using your prior knowledge
                        from past projects and studies is a valuable skill,
                        which I believe I can grow through this placement.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Action Plan:</b> In order to achieve this goal, I
                        will learn various new technologies and ways to program.
                        The experience I gain from a real job in my field will
                        be invaluable for me. Primarily I will be polishing my
                        C# skills while also learning new tricks and skills that
                        will accelerate my programming to the next level.
                        Furthermore, I will be learning new technologies to
                        expand my technological literacy such as C++ and SVN and
                        gaining experience working in a real-life setting.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Measure of Success:</b> The way I would measure my
                        success for this goal would be to see how much I have
                        grown in my technological literacy. Have I learned new
                        skills and technologies that will assist me further in
                        my career? Did I effectively absorb all the new
                        information I learned throughout my placement?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Reflection:</b> My work term at Xiris definitely
                        helped me achieve my technological literacy goals. I
                        learned and polished my knowledge of two new languages:
                        C# and C++, as well as a new software version control
                        system, Apache Subversion. This knowledge will
                        definitely aid me in future jobs and tech opportunities.

                      <p>
                        <b>Goal:</b> My last goal I would like to achieve
                        through my co-op placement is to be better organized and
                        better manage my time. Sometimes I have time management
                        issues and this placement is extremely valuable in
                        helping me solve these issues and grow as a person. I
                        believe being organized heavily increases productivity
                        and is a very useful skill to adapt not only in a
                        workplace setting but in day to day life.

                      <p>
                        <b>Action Plan:</b> I will be provided a lot of autonomy
                        in my setting and will need to learn how to manage my
                        time wisely. I prefer working on site because it
                        motivates me to install routine values into my day to
                        day life and pushes me to always be punctual. Planning
                        out deadlines for myself will be crucial in helping me
                        become more organized and more efficient in my work.

                        <b>Measure of Success:</b> The way I would measure my
                        success for this final goal is have I improved my
                        organization and time management? Not exclusively in a
                        workplace setting but have the values I learned
                        throughout my placement helped me become not only a more
                        organized, well rounded worker but also a more
                        organized, well rounded person.

                      <p>
                        <b>Reflection:</b> Looking back I believe I acheived my
                        organization and time management goals. My ability to
                        focus has improved and I always make sure to have enough
                        time to spare when completing a task.

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In my three months working at Xiris Automation Inc, I
                        feel like I have accomplished a lot and learned a
                        tremendous amount. For my first major project, I was
                        tasked with creating a document management system in C#
                        for Xiris’ internal documents. This Windows application
                        was to be designed with the ability to create, read,
                        update and delete documents that were subsequently
                        stored online in a Sharepoint server. Each document was
                        also to be reported in a database that provided further
                        information on it. Xiris had a previous outdated
                        document system which stored the files locally that I
                        could use as a reference to see what they were looking
                        for in terms of functionality. This project came with
                        its fair share of challenges. Having previously only
                        used C# in high school, I needed to quickly adapt to my
                        environment and reach a level of literacy with C# that
                        would allow me to complete my task. I think I managed to
                        do this quite well and I feel very confident in my C#
                        abilities following this work term. Another challenging
                        portion was learning how to connect everything to
                        Sharepoint and figuring out how to use the C# Sharepoint
                        CSOM (Client-Side Object Model). Learning the Sharepoint
                        CSOM resulted in a good amount of researching online and
                        reading through the documentation. When I completed the
                        project, the day came where we finally had to publish
                        and implement the new Sharepoint based document
                        management system. This required uploading all local
                        documents to the Sharepoint Online server and releasing
                        the new software onto the company servers. Most of this
                        process went smoothly, however a small oversight
                        occurred. The Sharepoint login system I created failed
                        to take 2FA into account which effectively nullified the
                        whole project I created. Rather than getting
                        discouraged, I looked into solutions for this and
                        swiftly found a way better method of implementing the
                        Sharepoint login which drastically improved the end
                        result. The new document management system was
                        successfully released on the anticipated date.

                        <b><u>Second Major Project</u></b>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For my second major project while working at Xiris
                        Automation, I was asked to familiarize myself with their
                        Weld SDK and simulate the process of installing and
                        using the SDK from the perspective of a first-time user
                        noting any flaws with the process. I read through all of
                        the documentation for the software development kit and
                        noted any spelling mistakes or sections that might be
                        perceived as unclear. Once I was finished with the
                        quality assurance, I was then asked to create a couple
                        of samples for the machine vision aspect of the SDK.
                        This was one of the most interesting parts of my work
                        term at Xiris. I was provided with one of their cameras
                        and wrote C++ code samples that demonstrate the
                        different machine vision functionalities available in
                        the SDK. These samples would be included in the SDK when
                        installed. Before this project, I have never used C++,
                        which was more difficult to grasp than C# given its
                        syntax. Eventually after looking through some C++
                        samples online and the Weld SDK documentation, I
                        successfully managed to write some functioning machine
                        vision code that reported on the camera’s video stream
                        in real time.

                      The experience I have gained from my first ever co-op
                      position was invaluable. I really enjoyed being put in a
                      real-world technological environment at an established
                      company and feeling a sense of progress with every task I
                      completed. There were ups and downs to my work term, but
                      each challenge only forced me to become a better worker
                      and a better person. I am grateful that I had this
                      opportunity and I am extremely excited to see what the
                      future has in store for me.

                      I would like to thank Xiris Automation Inc. for allowing
                      me to grow and learn many new skills while being
                      surrounded by a friendly and supportive environment. I
                      would also like to thank my manager John Stevenson for
                      being there with me from the interview process to my final
                      day. John was always extremely understanding and
                      supportive, he really allowed me to develop new skills
                      without being constrained by the fear of failure. To all
                      my other co-workers, thank you for welcoming me with open
                      arms and always having my back whenever I needed it. I am
                      truly thankful to have been able to spend this Summer with
                      everyone at Xiris and I look forward to seeing if our
                      paths ever cross again.
