      <h4 class="text-center">Welcome to my portfolio.</h4>
      <p class="text-center">
        Thanks for checking out this website. Ever since I was a child I have
        been fascinated by computers and the seemingly mystic aura surrounding
        them. Throughout my childhood, I would enjoy browsing the early days of
        YouTube, investigating my mother's Blackberry Bold and playing Pokemon
        Emerald on my Gameboy Advance. I look back throughout my life and at
        each stage in my journey there is something that has always remained a
        constant although it was perpetually changing;
        <b>computers</b>.<br /><br />
        Since that time, I have developed a good amount of knowledge in the
        field of computing. I enjoy tough technical challenges and always put
        forth my best efforts towards anything I do when it comes to the field
        that I love. My name is Jakub Wozniak and I am currently 20 years old. I
        was born in Stalowa Wola, Poland and I immigrated to Canada with my
        family when I was 4 years old. Currently, I am studying at the
        University of Guelph, where I am pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Computer
        Science as well as completing a Business minor on the side. I hope this
        website can serve as a tool that grants a view into my life with
        computers.

                Everglade Messaging is an online messaging web app which was
                created and designed as a side project. Both the backend and the

                      In this section, I will be presenting a full overview of

                    <p>
                      Over the Summer 2021 semester I had the pleasure of
                      working for a company by the name of Xiris Automation Inc.
                      in Burlington, Ontario. Xiris specializes in developing
                      machine vision hardware for process and quality control.
                      They have been in the business for over 30 years and have
                      developed high quality cameras focused on weld monitoring
                      and inspection. Xiris’ products provide manufacturers with
                      the ability to accurately detect, recognize and interpret
                      quality defects in their goods. Their cameras also come
                      with a software development kit, Xiris Weld SDK, which
                      allows users to maximize the potential of the cameras and
                      obtain useful machine vision information during the
                      welding process. Xiris has fostered a very welcoming and
                      supportive work environment that ultimately leads to great
                      internal productivity and collaboration.

                    <div class="container">
                      <p>
                        <b><u>Problem Solving</u></b>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Goal:</b> My first goal I would like to achieve
                        through my Summer 2021 co-op is to improve my
                        problem-solving skills. I believe problem solving is one
                        of the most important assets for a programmer as
                        constantly and unexpectedly issues can arise in code. I
                        believe having the skill to quickly identify those
                        problems and deal with them in an efficient manner is
                        extremely beneficial.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Action Plan:</b> In order to achieve this goal, I
                        will be placed in a real-world tech environment where I
                        will have a lot of opportunities to problem solve. Any
                        software I write will mostly likely have bugs and other
                        issues I will have to learn to overcome. These may be
                        challenging but will help me grow in my field. In a real
                        world setting I will be more motivated than ever to
                        improve myself as a coder and learn the best methods of
                        trouble shooting which I can transfer into my future
                        career path.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Measure of Success:</b> The way I would measure my
                        success is looking back and seeing if the quality and
                        efficiency of my solutions to problems has increased. Do
                        I try to think more analytically, do I analyze a bunch
                        of options and pick the best one?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Reflection:</b> My efficiency of problem-solving has
                        improved over these past four months. Given a lot of
                        autonomy and having to make a lot of decisions, I needed
                        to learn to think analytically and how to make the best
                        decisions. This skill will be extremely useful for any
                        other tech jobs I will have going forward in my career.

                        <b><u>Technological Literacy</u></b>

                      <p>
                        <b>Goal:</b> My second goal I would like to achieve
                        through my co-op is to improve my technological
                        literacy. Having a lot of different programming
                        languages and experiences in your toolbox is very
                        advantageous in the technology industry. Being able to
                        adapt to your environment using your prior knowledge
                        from past projects and studies is a valuable skill,
                        which I believe I can grow through this placement.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Action Plan:</b> In order to achieve this goal, I
                        will learn various new technologies and ways to program.
                        The experience I gain from a real job in my field will
                        be invaluable for me. Primarily I will be polishing my
                        C# skills while also learning new tricks and skills that
                        will accelerate my programming to the next level.
                        Furthermore, I will be learning new technologies to
                        expand my technological literacy such as C++ and SVN and
                        gaining experience working in a real-life setting.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Measure of Success:</b> The way I would measure my
                        success for this goal would be to see how much I have
                        grown in my technological literacy. Have I learned new
                        skills and technologies that will assist me further in
                        my career? Did I effectively absorb all the new
                        information I learned throughout my placement?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Reflection:</b> My work term at Xiris definitely
                        helped me achieve my technological literacy goals. I
                        learned and polished my knowledge of two new languages:
                        C# and C++, as well as a new software version control
                        system, Apache Subversion. This knowledge will
                        definitely aid me in future jobs and tech opportunities.

                        better manage my time. Sometimes I have time management
                        issues and this placement is extremely valuable in
                        helping me solve these issues and grow as a person. I
                        believe being organized heavily increases productivity
                        and is a very useful skill to adapt not only in a
                        workplace setting but in day to day life.

                        <b>Action Plan:</b> I will be provided a lot of autonomy
                        in my setting and will need to learn how to manage my
                        time wisely. I prefer working on site because it
                        motivates me to install routine values into my day to
                        day life and pushes me to always be punctual. Planning
                        out deadlines for myself will be crucial in helping me
                        become more organized and more efficient in my work.

                        organization and time management? Not exclusively in a
                        workplace setting but have the values I learned
                        throughout my placement helped me become not only a more

                      <p>
                        In my three months working at Xiris Automation Inc, I
                        feel like I have accomplished a lot and learned a
                        tremendous amount. For my first major project, I was
                        tasked with creating a document management system in C#
                        for Xiris’ internal documents. This Windows application
                        was to be designed with the ability to create, read,
                        update and delete documents that were subsequently
                        stored online in a Sharepoint server. Each document was
                        also to be reported in a database that provided further
                        information on it. Xiris had a previous outdated
                        document system which stored the files locally that I
                        could use as a reference to see what they were looking
                        for in terms of functionality. This project came with
                        its fair share of challenges. Having previously only
                        used C# in high school, I needed to quickly adapt to my
                        environment and reach a level of literacy with C# that
                        would allow me to complete my task. I think I managed to
                        do this quite well and I feel very confident in my C#
                        abilities following this work term.
                        <br /><br />
                        Another challenging portion was learning how to connect
                        everything to Sharepoint and figuring out how to use the
                        C# Sharepoint CSOM (Client-Side Object Model). Learning
                        the Sharepoint CSOM resulted in a good amount of
                        researching online and reading through the
                        documentation. When I completed the project, the day
                        came where we finally had to publish and implement the
                        new Sharepoint based document management system. This
                        required uploading all local documents to the Sharepoint
                        Online server and releasing the new software onto the
                        company servers. Most of this process went smoothly,
                        however a small oversight occurred. The Sharepoint login
                        system I created failed to take 2FA into account which
                        effectively nullified the whole project I created.
                        Rather than getting discouraged, I looked into solutions
                        for this and swiftly found a way better method of
                        implementing the Sharepoint login which drastically
                        improved the end result. The new document management
                        system was successfully released on the anticipated
                        date.
                        <br /><br />
                        For my second major project while working at Xiris
                        Automation, I was asked to familiarize myself with their
                        Weld SDK and simulate the process of installing and
                        using the SDK from the perspective of a first-time user
                        noting any flaws with the process. I read through all of
                        the documentation for the software development kit and
                        noted any spelling mistakes or sections that might be
                        perceived as unclear. Once I was finished with the
                        quality assurance, I was then asked to create a couple
                        of samples for the machine vision aspect of the SDK.
                        This was one of the most interesting parts of my work
                        term at Xiris. I was provided with one of their cameras
                        and wrote C++ code samples that demonstrate the
                        different machine vision functionalities available in
                        the SDK. These samples would be included in the SDK when
                        installed. Before this project, I have never used C++,
                        which was more difficult to grasp than C# given its
                        syntax. Eventually after looking through some C++
                        samples online and the Weld SDK documentation, I
                        successfully managed to write some functioning machine
                        vision code that reported on the camera’s video stream
                        in real time.

                      company and feeling a sense of progress with every task I
                      completed. There were ups and downs to my work term, but
                      each challenge only forced me to become a better worker
                      and a better person. I am grateful that I had this

                        through my co-op is to improve my technological

                        the computer programming industry you must develop a
                        breadth of knowledge with various technologies. Having a
                        lot of different languages and skills in your toolbox is
                        very valuable and I feel that this placement will
                        accomplish that for me.

                      <p>
                        <b>Action Plan:</b> In order to achieve this goal, I
                        will be taking a dive into aspects of computer science
                        that I normally haven’t spent much time on. With this
                        placement, I will be learning new skills and tricks to
                        website development. Primarily, I will be greatly
                        improving my HTML, CSS and JS capabilities and learning
                        how the website development process works in a
                        real-world scenario. This sort of hands-on experience in
                        a professional environment will be valuable for the
                        future growth of myself and my career.

                        <b>Measure of Success:</b> The way I would measure my
                        success for this goal would be to see how much my skills
                        have improved over the course of my work term. Do I
                        understand web development better than I did coming into
                        this job? Could I apply the things I learned in future
                        scenarios, be it personal projects or future jobs?

                        over this work term is creativity. I feel like this is
                        one of the most overlooked aspects of computer science.
                        In my opinion, in order to be innovative, successful and
                        create something groundbreaking you need to have the
                        ability to think creatively. To me, this placement is an
                        ideal opportunity to work on this skill.

                        countless opportunities to test my creativity with
                        various designs and ideas. With web development, you
                        have the freedom to experiment with certain pieces of
                        styling, as well as the opportunity to try different
                        layouts. I believe that this nature of testing designs
                        will apply not only to web development but could also
                        benefit me in other aspects of computer science.

                        success for this goal is to look back on the work term

                        improved. After this work term, do I come up with more
                        ideas? Do I see myself testing various pieces of code
                        more often and trying things I wouldn’t normally try?

                        through my co-op placement is to improve my teamwork.
                        This skill is very important in a computer science job,
                        but also crucial in daily life. Skills that have the
                        ability to be transferred to every aspect of your life
                        and help you grow as a person are valuable and
                        definitely worth working on.

                        <b>Action Plan:</b> In order to achieve this goal, I
                        look forward to participating in meetings and
                        collaborating with different co-workers on projects. I
                        will be a part of a group in a real-world technological
                        environment and learn how to cooperate and communicate
                        with team members. Furthermore, working with others will
                        also help me pick up certain technological skills they
                        have and learn solutions to problems that I normally
                        wouldn’t figure out on my own.

                        I work better with people after my work term? Have I
                        become better at listening to my co-workers and aligning
                        priorities to work in a group where everyone feels heard

                        Over the past four months working for the University of
                        Guelph, I have gained tons of valuable experience with
                        web development that I will definitely apply in personal
                        projects and in my future career. Throughout the
                        semester, I was presented with a variety of work item
                        tickets to accomplish on Azure DevOps. This helped me
                        stay focused and provided me with tasks that I had to
                        figure out and accomplish.
                        <br /><br />
                        To start off the work term, I began by familiarizing
                        myself with the main git repository for the University
                        of Guelph website. This involved getting to grips with
                        PHP and understanding how their main code base was
                        structured. I had to brush up on my HTML and learn how
                        to properly structure HTML code utilizing divs and other
                        elements. I learned about JavaScript web components,
                        including how to create, compile and utilize them on a
                        website. Furthermore, I learned how to locally host a
                        server environment using MAMP and polished my version
                        control knowledge by using git to commit and pull
                        changes with Azure DevOps.
                        <br /><br />
                        My next task was to create a prototype framework of a
                        brand-new modernized programs page for the university.
                        This was my first major task I was assigned when I
                        joined the group. To accomplish this task, I was given
                        some concept drawings of what sort of vision the team
                        had for this new page. I studied and learned a lot of
                        CSS and Bootstrap to be able to accomplish what they
                        were looking for. This challenge tested my HTML, PHP,
                        CSS, JavaScript and problem-solving abilities. I had to
                        look up how to accomplish certain things with CSS since
                        I never really looked into it and the caliber of my CSS
                        greatly improved due to this project. In the end I was
                        able to successfully create a functioning programs page
                        framework that I presented to the team in a meeting on
                        Microsoft Teams.
                        <br /><br />
                        Another task I frequently worked on throughout the
                        semester was updating the campus map (<a
                          href="https://uoguelph.ca/maps"
                          >www.uoguelph.ca/maps</a
                        >). This required me to add new buildings using latitude
                        and longitude points to plot out polygons and implement
                        them using the Google Maps API. I needed to add these
                        points into a JSON file that was then passed into some
                        JavaScript that initialized the map. Each marker on the
                        map is also linked to a locations page which needed to
                        be filled in with information about the building and
                        implemented with the proper photos. This part of the job
                        was very rewarding as I constantly got to see visual
                        progress of new buildings popping up on the map and
                        being implemented into the live uoguelph.ca website.
